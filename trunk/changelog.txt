       the compatible format is : #xxxw#xxd#xxh#xxm#xxs#xx. where xxx stands for any numbers;
      and w= weeks, d days, h hours m minutes, s seconds, . milliseconds.
      # is a parsing delimitator. If a number is 0, it can be skipped.
      Example : #1w#3h#55m#2s = 1 week , 0 days, 3 hours, 55 minutes 2 seconds and 0 millis.

Account flyable means that : if account has a password set, the last nick used will be possible to be used to 
log in to account, if password is ok. Then, the CID of the new client is being memorized for the account. 
To be flyable, the nick must NOT be protected, so when you check flyable, its being auto deactivated.
